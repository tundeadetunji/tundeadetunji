<p>Started out in 2009 when I tried creating School Management software for schools. Knew very little, but the dream was <strong>big</strong>. Got favorable feedbacks and enjoyed successes. Learnt .Net Framework, SQL, Java and Android along the way. In my next employment, I was able to apply what I learnt to my work building customer-facing applications. By then, I already had libraries of over 30, 000 lines of code (see <a href="https://github.com/tundeadetunji/api-dot_net-all_modules" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tundeadetunji/api-java-code" target="_blank">here</a>), and that came in handy for day to day work.</p>

<p>Love to join your organization and contribute to business success and customer success.</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tundeadetunji/" target="blank">LinkedIn</a>âœŒ - would be happy to know what I can do for you.</p> 

<p>Have a great day!ðŸ˜€</p>
